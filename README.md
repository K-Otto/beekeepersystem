Problem
At present there is not adequate written record keeping. It is required :
To ensure that the hives are checked regularly – even more of a necessity since the outbreak of AFB in the Western Cape – also 2-3 brood frames need to be replaced annually.
Optimize honey production. By weighing and ‘dating’ the supers before taking it to the apiary sites and then again upon return, there will be a truer reflection of which site produces more honey.  Hives can then be moved between sites if needed.
By recording the bucketed honey – weight, taste – and matching that to sales you will see which honey is preferred by customers and could then also address the amount of hives at the apiary sites for optimum production of the preferred honey
